            <p>Yo! I'm Bryan, a Full Stack Developer with a BS in Finance. I enjoy backend development and working with databases, so most of my projects have been focused on data collection and analysis. When I'm not coding, you can find me in the gym, analyzing stocks, spending time with my wife and cats, exploring new places, and playing tennis. I believe in working hard to achieve your goals and build the life you want. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!</p>
